If you think of the web as a big show and tell event, we have copy which is the "tell" and we have images and other visual elements that are the "tell".

Static visual elements can't compete that well with copy when it comes to conveying a clear and thorough message. For example a static image of a phone app doesn't usually by itself tell what the app can do or give the user a sense of what the app might feel like to use.

But if we add a few screen transitions or something that resembles a typical workflow we can communicate things visually that can't really be communicated with text alone.

If this app is well-designed and intuitive there's no need for internationalization or translation services. When something is intuitive its behaviors are localized.

Hardware acceleration
Use translate3d instead of left and right, margin, etc
Some tests have shown that newer versions of clients have switched to automatically enabling hardware acceleration for a number of properties


Animation is the most skuomorphic development we can do. It's bringing some part of reality to the interface which makes it feel more alive, real and tangible.
